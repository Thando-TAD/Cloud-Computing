It's that it help reduce costs because you only pay for the resources you use, and it provides flexibility to scale up or down depending on your needs. The difference shared responsibility between AWS and the Customer is that AWS responsibility is the security of the cloud, then the responsibilty of the customer is the security in the cloud.
